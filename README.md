Project Name: File Monitoring and Notification Service

Project Description:
This Windows Service application monitors specified file extensions in a given directory and tracks any changes made to the files (such as creation, modification, or deletion). Whenever a change is detected, the service sends an email notification to a user-specified email address. The service runs in the background and automatically starts when the system boots up.

Features:
- Monitoring specific file extensions (e.g., .txt, .docx)
- Detecting file changes (creation, modification, deletion)
- Sending email notifications to a specified address when changes occur
- Low resource usage as it runs continuously in the background
- Can be installed and run as a Windows Service

Installation Steps:
1. Build the Application:
   - First, open the project in an IDE like Visual Studio and build it.
   - Ensure that the correct version of the .NET Framework is installed if required.

2. Installing as a Windows Service:
   - To install the application as a Windows Service, use the InstallUtil.exe utility.
     - Open the Command Prompt as an administrator and run the following command:
       C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework
4.0.30319\InstallUtil.exe "PathToYourApplication\YourAppName.exe"
   - If you are on a 64-bit system, make sure to use the InstallUtil from the Framework64 folder.

3. Starting the Service:
   - After installing the service, open the "Services" panel by running services.msc in the Run dialog.
   - Locate the installed service, right-click on it, and select "Start."
   - The service will automatically start each time the system boots.

4. Configuration:
   - The monitored directory, file extensions, and other settings are defined in the configuration file (config file) of the application.
   - The recipient email address and SMTP server settings can also be configured here.

5. Email Settings:
   - Specify the SMTP server, email address, password, and recipient email address in the configuration file.
   - The application will send notifications to this email when file changes are detected.

6. Troubleshooting:
   - If the service doesn’t work as expected, check the Event Viewer for error logs.
   - Log files can also be created to help identify any issues.

User Instructions:
1. Select the directory and file extension you want to monitor for changes.
2. Specify the email address where you’d like to receive notifications about file changes.
3. Start the service, and you’ll receive email alerts whenever changes occur in the monitored files.

Requirements:
- Windows operating system
- .NET Framework (make sure the correct version is installed)
- Internet connection for SMTP email settings
